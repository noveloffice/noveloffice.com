        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">The Novel Office Website collects information through a variety of different
            ways and for different
            purposes. If you choose to register with the Novel Office Websites, then you will be requested to provide

            the services on our site in which you have expressed interest. We may also use your contact information to
            send you information about other Novel Office services.</p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">We may also use your contact information to send you information about our
            products and services related to
            office spaces, such as meeting rooms, virtual offices, workplace recovery, offices, co-working and

            believe that the information is sensitive or our use of the information may include other uses not covered
            by this Privacy Policy or another privacy notice to which we have made available to you.</p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">Novel Office Websites automatically collects technical information about your

            Internet service provider, platform type, internet protocol (IP) addresses, referring/exit pages, operating
            system, date/time stamp). We do not associate this information with other information about you. We

            may, subject to applicable law, voluntarily provide information in order to assist in a law enforcement
            investigation or where the disclosure is necessary to protect our systems, our business or the rights of
