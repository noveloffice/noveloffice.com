            Cookies are tiny text files that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or tablet. They won’t pose any
            security threat to your computer and have nothing to do with viruses. When you visit a website, the cookies
            enable the website to ‘remember’ you and how you have used the website every time you went back to the
            website, which means you get a much better online experience.</p>
        <div class="rs-privacy-empty-spacer"></div>

            If you want to know more about cookies then you can get information readily available online.</p>

        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">
            If you don’t want to receive cookies you can modify your browser so that you receive notification when they
            are sent to you. You can decline cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.

        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">
            We use, Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (Google) which uses cookies to
            help us analyze how the website is used by you to improve your experience in our systems.</p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">A so-called “User ID” will be used on this website. The User ID functions as
            your alias in Google Analytics. Google connects your online behavior and the User-ID to a profile. Google
            Analytics tracks your activities anonymously across multiple devices like your tablet, pc and smartphone.
        </p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website
            (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers. Google will use this
            information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for
            us and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer
            this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
            information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by
            Google.</p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">Google only receives the User-ID, not the information contained in the
            above-mentioned profile or other personal data of yours. A summarized version of the profile created is
            accessible to us. We do not attach any other of your personally identifiable data to the profile connected
            to a User-ID. You can opt out of tracking via User ID by sending an e-mail to <a
                href="mailto:optout@noveloffice.in" class="rs-privacy-policy-hyper">optout@noveloffice.in</a></p>
        <p class="rs-privacy-policy-text">You may also refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings
            on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality
            of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the
            manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
